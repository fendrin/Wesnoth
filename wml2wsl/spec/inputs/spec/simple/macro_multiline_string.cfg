    {MESSAGE narrator "wesnoth-icon.png" "" _"This scenario demonstrates a variety of different uses of the Goto Micro AI. All AI sides are controlled by this MAI in one way or another (except for the saurians, which are run by the Lurkers Micro AI). Messages will be displayed throughout the scenario to point out what the units are doing.

The player controls Side 1. There are right-click context menu options for adding Side 1 units to the map and for taking them off again. This is useful mostly for testing how the Side 3 guardians react.

Note: The Goto AI is coded as a Micro AI. A Micro AI can be added and adapted to the need of a scenario easily using only WML and the [micro_ai] tag. Check out the <span color='#00A000'>Micro AI wiki page</span> at http://wiki.wesnoth.org/Micro_AIs for more information."}
