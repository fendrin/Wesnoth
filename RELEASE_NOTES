This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="Updated OS X user data directory"]
The OS X user data directory is now ~/Library/Application Support/Wesnoth_1.13, in preparation for the upcoming development release, Wesnoth 1.13.0. This means that preferences and add-ons need to be either reset/reloaded or be copied/linked from ~/Library/Application Support/Wesnoth_1.11.
[/section]

[section="fearless/healthy [effect]s"]
instead of checking whether the trait id equals fearless/healthy we now have fearless/heathy [effect]s
this means especialy that umcaddons that use their own fearless/healthy traits have to add those [effect]s in them.
[/section]

[section="Changes to the Mushroom Grove overlay terrain"]
The Mushroom Grove changes in 1.11.16 were reverted, mushroom grove will now behave stats-wise just as it did in 1.10. 

This topic will perhaps be revisited for 1.14.0

[section="Buggy Carryover WML feature removed"]
Version 1.11.7 (check this) from just before feature freeze introduced a "carryover WML" feature, wherein the [endlevel] tag might contain child tags which would get merged into the scenario config for the next scenario. This allows for a secnario to dynamically reconfigure the next scenario. Unfortunately, it was a bit buggy, didn't actually work properly in networked mp, and would have been very difficult to fix. There are also many other ways to achieve this, for one you can use modifications or have scenarios pass variables to eachother. The main use case for this feature was, what if you want to transition to a scenario maintained by someone else, but you would like to aggressively reconfigure it, adding new events or overwriting events in that scenario. There are other things you could do with carryover WML, like have a scenario that loops and dynamically reconfigures itself. But reconfiguring a scenario whose contents you don't actually control is probably the main use I had in mind for this. (Note that you can still just fork someone else's content and make a new version which reads variables to allow it to be reconfigured, so I don't think there is loss in power to remove this.)

Another point raised in internal discussion is that it would probably be more useful if this feature applied before random map generation occurred, which when it was first implemented wasn't how it worked. Since there are many changes planned to this scenario generation code path, for instance the merging of mp and sp, and this feature adds a fair bit of complication, we decided to shelf it and perhaps rethink it later.

[section="play single move button in replay mode"]
A button that allows playing one move at a time in replay mode has been added.
[/section]

[section="Multiplayer Alerts"]
The multiplayer alerts, i.e. the sounds and desktop notifications such as related to mp lobby events and chat messages, can now be configured under Preferences > Multiplayer > Alerts. Individual events, such as players joining or leaving, private messages, messages from friends, etc. may now prompt a sound or notification, and may be handled differently in the lobby vs. in game. The advanced preference "lobby sounds" has been removed. The particular sound files which are played for each of these types of events, may now be easily reconfigured by changing some attributes in data/game_config.cfg.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[list][*] The mp server has trouble with "Local" player types in campaigns. We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of wesnoth. https://gna.org/bugs/?21965
[*] Text for entry2.
