This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES

[section="Example section header"]
Example contents.
[/section]

[section="Updated OS X user data directory"]
The OS X user data directory is now ~/Library/Application Support/Wesnoth_1.13, in preparation for the upcoming development release, Wesnoth 1.13.0. This means that preferences and add-ons need to be either reset/reloaded or be copied/linked from ~/Library/Application Support/Wesnoth_1.11.
[/section]

[section="fearless/healthy [effect]s"]
instead of checking whether the trait id equals fearless/healthy we now have fearless/heathy [effect]s
this means especialy that umcaddons that use their own fearless/healthy traits have to add those [effect]s in them.
[/section]

[section="play single move button in replay mode"]
A button that allows playing one move at a time in replay mode has been added.
[/section]

[section="Multiplayer Alerts"]
The multiplayer alerts, i.e. the sounds and desktop notifications such as related to mp lobby events and chat messages, can now be configured under Preferences > Multiplayer > Alerts. Individual events, such as players joining or leaving, private messages, messages from friends, etc. may now prompt a sound or notification, and may be handled differently in the lobby vs. in game. The advanced preference "lobby sounds" has been removed. The particular sound files which are played for each of these types of events, may now be easily reconfigured by changing some attributes in data/game_config.cfg.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[list][*] The mp server has trouble with "Local" player types in campaigns. We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of wesnoth. https://gna.org/bugs/?21965
[*] Text for entry2.
