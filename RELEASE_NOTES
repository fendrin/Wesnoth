This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release
notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release
team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes
place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes
here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to
the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever
is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single
words.

The release team should empty this file after each release.

On Windows and Mac a log text in the mp command dialog could give an error
which threw players out the lobby. This problem seems to be an upstream problem
and is being further investigated. As workaround the length of the input is
limited to a save length. (The chatline is not affected.)
