This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="Improved WML load error reports"]
The user interface used for displaying WML errors during the content load and initialization phase (also known as “[i]Reading files and creating cache[/i]”) has received a complete makeover in this version:

[list]
[*]The list of affected add-ons in the summary is now displayed in a bulleted format when applicable, and add-ons are identified by their regular names (or approximations thereof when those are unavailable) instead of the complete paths to their [tt]_main.cfg[/tt] files.
[*]Users are encouraged to report any errors found to the add-on authors or maintainers. A new button is available above the detailed report to copy it to clipboard, e.g., for including it in a forum post without having to upload large screenshots or checking stderr.
[*]Parser implementation details (specifically, “value ‘[i]token[/i]’ at [i]location[/i]”) are no longer included in the report since they don’t really help WML authors with debugging.
[*]Error messages that point to chains of file and line locations have those displayed in separate indented lines to avoid the “text wall” effect.
[/list]

Additionally, the format used for logging these errors to stderr has changed:
[list]
[*]Messages for errors from multiple add-ons are now sent to stderr one by one as they happen, rather than printed all at once at the end of the loading phase.
[*]The indented format used in the UI is used in stderr now as well.
