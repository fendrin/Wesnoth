This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="RCA (default) AI gold saving default is reverted back to 'off'"]
Based on the feedback we have gotten, we turned gold saving off by default for the RCA AI. There is no clear overall benefit to having it turned on and it would require many scenarios to be rebalanced. There are, however, individual scenarios which definitely benefit from enabling gold saving. Help with identifying such scenarios will be much appreciated.

[section="Son of the Black Eye campaign rebalancing"]
Rebalancing of the campaign continues and is done for scenarios 1 (“End of Peace”) through 12 (“Giving Some Back”). [b]Play-testing and feedback by others would be extremely helpful at this time.[/b] The first newly rebalanced scenario of this release is “Shan Taum the Smug”, but some earlier scenarios have seen minor changes as well.
