This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES
=======

[section="Minor Add-ons Manager improvement"]
Since the Update Add-ons shortcut in the add-ons server connection dialog was removed in version 1.11.0, the Update All (add-ons) functionality became considerably less visible. To address this, the Update All button is now available on all Add-on Manager views, and enabled whenever there is at least one add-on on the list that may be upgraded.
[/section]

[section="Fixed WML load error reporting"]
A change introduced in version 1.11.15 caused WML parser/preprocessor errors found at game/add-on load time to not be reported to the player in the GUI, and the game to carry on with a incomplete and malformed WML tree in most cases. This issue was [url=http://r.wesnoth.org/p571380]reported[/url] on the forums by SkyOne and is fixed in this release.
[/section]

[section="Fixed whiteboard unit continuation problem"]
Blocker bug #22231 has now been fixed and unit continuations in planning mode should work as expected.
[/section]

[section="Changes to the Mushroom Groove overlay terrain"]
A change to the way how the Mushroom Groove terrain works might cause the need for some map rebalancing.
Previously the mixed fungus terrain worked always like plain Mushroom Groove, now it is handled like the forest overlays.
Movement is taken from the worst of both, defense is taken from the best value.
[/section]

[section="Savegame map preview bugs fixed"]
Fixed bug that caused incorrect / missing minimap data to be displayed in the preview pane when loading a saved game. If more problems are observed, please report.

Note that you must refresh your save_index to get proper behavior, by deleting it from the userdata folder.
[/section]

[section="Bugfixes for [filter_vision]"]
The [filter_vision] tag introduced in 1.11 series was discovered to have some bugs, it would behave with different logic depending on whether it was in a unit filter or a location filter. Neither of these implementations was actually quite right, and the simplest way to fix it was to make it work as originally intended. In 1.11.16 and future versions of wesnoth, [filter_vision] works like most other tags such as [has_unit], that is, 
[list][*]When used in a unit filter, a [filter_vision] check succeeds if there is [b]any[/b] side with vision of the unit (no fog there and unit is not hiding from that side) which passes the side filter in [filter_vision], and fails otherwise.
[*] When used in a terrain_filter, a [filter_vision] check succeeds if there is [b]any[/b] side with vision of the location (no fog there, or if respect_fog=false, then no shroud there) which passes the side filter in [filter_vision], and fails otherwise.
[/list]

The [allied_with] / [enemy_of] tags in side filter had some related issues -- they were originally intended to match if *any* side matches the filter, but they
ended up being implemented in a needlessly confusing manner, where they in most cases match if *all* sides matching the filter are allies / enemies, but if 
there are none then they report false anyways. To work around this [has_ally] and [has_enemy] have been added, which correctly match when *any* side matching 
the filter is an ally or enemy.

Thus excepting for [allied_with] / [enemy_of], all filters in 1.11.16+ are simply a check for *any* object matching the filter data.

==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========

[list][*] Start of scenario saves have some known bugs, they can't be loaded correctly and they don't get minimaps in the preview pane. (The preview part of this is by design however, the map is not known for a start of scenario save at the time of the load dialog and it cannot be previewed.)
[*]Example issue 2 (bug [bug]98765[/bug]).
