This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

KNOWN BUGS

[list]
[*] Start of scenario saves have some known bugs in multiplayer
[*] There are some known bugs with hotkeys:
    [list]
    [*][bug] 21983 [/bug] you cannot clear some default hotkeys with the "clear hotkeys" menu option. This will not be treated as a bug in 1.12.
    [*][bug] 22219 [/bug] problems with hotkeys using ctrl, alt.
    [/list]
[*] Legend of wesmere campaign has some bugs in mp:
    [list]
    [*]In some scenarios the players get too much or too few carryover gold (which makes some scenarios badly balanced in gerneral).
    [*]Using 'shuffle sides' in Legend of wesmere will cause several bugs.
    [*]In some scenarios sides get additional recuits from a randomly picked mp faction.
    [/list]
[*] OOS can still happen in multiplayer games:
    [list]
    [*][bug] 23316 [/bug] if first a game is reloaded in multiplayer and then moves are undone that were made before saving the game OOS will appear.
    [*] Undoing moves after a controller was changed during that turn of that side (for example with :control or becasue a players left) causes OOS.
    [*] Putting units on the recall list with wml/lua causes OOS if that unit is recalled by the player in the same scenario where it was put to the recall list. This can be fixed by giving the unit an id manually in a synced way.
    [/list]
[*]Example issue 2 (bug [bug]98765[/bug]).
