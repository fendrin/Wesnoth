This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="Add-ons Manager improvements"]
In this release, new sorting options have been added to the Add-ons Manager dialog to improve its usefulness. The new options allow to change the neutral sorting criterion between [i]By name[/i] (which continues to be the default), [i]By last updated[/i], and [i]By first upload[/i] (former default in all versions prior to 1.11.0); additionally, it is possible to switch between ascending and descending order. Due to UI framework limitations, these options only take effect when no column has been marked for sorting in the add-ons list.

[section="Other miscellaneous add-on management improvements"]
The Remove Add-ons dialog now displays add-ons with their real names from the add-ons server as opposed to their file/directory names with underscores removed. This is only effective for add-ons downloaded with this and future versions.

Syntax errors in .pbl files are now reported properly in the user interface instead of being misclassified as network errors.

Finally, some color key disparities between the Add-ons Manager view and the Description box (which were unintentionally using different shades of orange and green) have been fixed.
