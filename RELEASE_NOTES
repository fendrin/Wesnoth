This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

CHANGES
=======

[section="Example section header"]
Example contents.
[/section]

[section="fearless/healthy [effect]s"]
instead of checking whether the trait id equals fearless/healthy we now have fearless/heathy [effect]s
this means especialy that umcaddons that use their own fearless/healthy traits have to add those [effect]s in them.
[/section]

[section="play single move button in replay mode"]
A button that allows playing one move at a time in replay mode has been added. Thanks to Zappaman for this.
[/section]

[section="Multiplayer Alerts"]
The multiplayer alerts, i.e. the sounds and desktop notifications such as related to mp lobby events and chat messages, can now be configured under Preferences > Multiplayer > Alerts. Individual events, such as players joining or leaving, private messages, messages from friends, etc. may now prompt a sound or notification, and may be handled differently in the lobby vs. in game. The advanced preferences "lobby sounds" and "desktop notifications" have been removed, having been subsumed by this new screen. The particular sound files which are played for each of these types of events, may now be easily reconfigured by changing some attributes in data/game_config.cfg.
[/section]

[section="Hyperlinks"]
Added support for hyperlinks to GUI2. This means that the chat log and also the addon descriptions pages should now support rendering and clicking on hyperlinks.
[/section]

[section="New Filesystem Code"]
Revised dependencies:

[list]
[*]SDL_mixer version ticked to 1.2.12
[*]Boost filesystem (new), at version 1.44.
[/list]

On Windows only, Boost filesystem is needed at version 1.48, for boost::locale.

The boost filesystem dep may be disabled, if compiling with scons, by passing it an argument. Then it will compile using the legacy filesystem code. (This may not be maintained in the long term, however.)

(The new SDL_mixer requirement cannot be similarly disabled.)

For those of you compiling Wesnoth on OS X using Xcode, this means that you need to download a new version of wesnoth_compile_mac_1.13.zip.
[/section]

[section="Help Browser"]
Many new features, see changelog.
[/section]

[section="--render-image command line argument"]
A new command-line argument "--render-image" has been added. It is similar to --screenshot, but instead of a map, it takes a wesnoth imagepath and generates at bitmap with the filters applied.

Example usage:
[code]
wesnoth --render-image "units/undead-skeletal/banebow-bow-attack-1.png~SCALE(144,144)" "banebow.bmp"
[/code]

will generate a scaled image of a banebow attack sprite.

==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========

[list][*] The mp server has trouble with "Local" player types in campaigns. We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of wesnoth. https://gna.org/bugs/?21965
[*] Text for entry2.
