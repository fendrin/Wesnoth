[section="Victory Conditions"]
Following developer discussions and discussions with UMC developers who had concerns about changes in 1.12 regarding the frequency with which the engine checks the victory conditions of a scenario, we decided to revamp our solution to this issue. The [tt] "fight_on_without_leader"=yes/no[/tt] attribute of [tt][side][/tt] has been replaced with [tt]"defeat_condition"=always/no_leader_left/no_units_left/never[/tt]. The default value is no_leader_left, preserving backwards compatibility. For gramatical cohesion, the [tt] "remove_from_carryover_on_leaders_loss" [/tt] attribute has been renamed [tt] "remove_from_carryover_on_defeat" [/tt].

In 1.11.15 and forward, wesnoth checks for victory / defeat of sides more or less at the end of any "game event". So, not only at the end of a turn or the beginning of a turn, but also at the end of moveto events and similar. It won't interrupt an attack to end the game, and I don't believe it will check in between two events with the same name, for example "side 2 turn 4". But you should assume it will check quite frequently.

The victory check process is simple: for each nonempty side (controller is not empty) wesnoth will check its victory condition according to the units on the map. Then, if any two non-defeated sides are enemies, the game will proceed. Otherwise, if victory when enemies defeated is false, and there is a not-defeated human-controlled side, the game will continue. In the remaining cases, the game will end.

The majority of campaigns will work exactly the same as before, and in many very simple cases the engine now works better than before. However, if some scene in your campaign doens't work properly anymore, because you were removing all the units, or expecting that they wouldn't be removed from carryover when their side was defeated, we expect that you now have all the tools you need to make it work, by settings sides to be "never defeated" before removing all their units, or toggling "remove_from_carry_over_on_defeat", etc.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[list][*] The mp server has trouble with "Local" player types in campaigns. We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of wesnoth. https://gna.org/bugs/?21965
