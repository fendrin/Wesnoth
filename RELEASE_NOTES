This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="Greatly improved unicode compliance"]
Previous versions of wesnoth were unable, on some platforms (especially windows) to properly handle unicode characters, particularly for filesystem related issues. The following features should now work with full UTF-8 on all platforms:

- Loading and saving WML
- Loading and saving games
- Loading images and sounds
- Loading fonts
- Loading translations
- Loading translated images
- Loading of files in lua
- Parsing command line arguments to wesnoth
- Copying and pasting unicode from the clipboard

In particular, on windows, it should now be possible to install wesnoth to a path with non-ascii characters.

[section="Dependency update"]
For the improvements just mentioned, it was necessary to increase the library dependencies of the game. By default, the game now requires:

Boost filesystem 1.44
Boost locale (introduced in boost 1.48)
SDL_mixer 1.2.12

For both scons and cmake, the first two may be disabled (and the old code used, rolling back results of previous section) by turning off the "enable boost filesystem" flag. For cmake, the third requirement may also be removed, reducing SDL_mixer dependency to 1.2.0, by using the ENABLE_PANDORA flag.
