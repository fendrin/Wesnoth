This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[section="Son of the Black Eye Rebalancing"]
Rebalancing of the campaign continues and is mostly done for Scenarios 1 (End of Peace) through 8 (Silent Forest) with only some fine tuning left to do. Play testing and feedback by others would be extremely helpful for this process. The first newly rebalanced scenario of this release is 'The Siege of Barag Gor'. Scenarios after 'Silent Forest' have also seen some changes but are not balanced yet.

[section="Userdata command line options"]
Since 1.9.0, Wesnoth obeys the XDG Basedir Specification, meaning that on X11-based systems, such as most linux distros, the userdata and the preferences have been split between $HOME/.local/share/wesnoth/<version> and $HOME/.config/wesnoth. The old command line options --config-dir and --config-path remained in place, referring to the userdata though. New options, --userdata-dir, --userdata-path, --userconfig-dir and --userconfig-path now replace these old ones.
