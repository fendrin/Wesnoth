    description: _ "Simple beings conjured up from soil and water, Mudcrawlers fend for themselves by spitting globs of mud with surprising force. Even though they are slow, fragile, and vulnerable to fire, their quick and easy creation, along with their resistance to a common citizenâ€™s improvised blunt weaponry, makes them the tool of choice for ambitious but inexperienced summoners."
