    description: _ "Those horsemen who are not skilled enough to join the ranks of the Faris or quick enough with a bow for the Saree are instead placed with the Qanas. Far from being a sign of failure, the Qanas were created as a mounted counterpart to the Muharib, supporting the foot troops with mace or bow as needed. Qanas are often used to draw enemies into a position where they will be surrounded and crushed by Faris."
