This is place to put any scenarios used by C++ unit tests.

It is good idea to reuse same scenario file as much as possible and just inject wml to that.
Injection can be done creating config object with event code inside and then registering that
manually for game_events.

It is also a good place to put scenarios which are WML unit tests.
