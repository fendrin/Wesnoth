# The purpose of this test is to check that units spawned on
# an occupied hex are placed at the nearest available vacant hex.
#
# Six blue grunts are spawned, one at 3,4 and five more at adjacent
# hexes, leaving the southern hex 3,5 open. 
# Then a red grunt is spawned at 3,4. 
# We try to store a unit at 3,5, assert that we find one, and that 
# it is red.
