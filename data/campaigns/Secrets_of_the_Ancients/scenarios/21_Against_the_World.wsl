-- Several enemies are placed on the map at the start. Three others are placed later on
-- specific turns. It is possible for the player to occupy their castles before they
-- appear, or wait nearby to assassinate them before they can recruit. This strategy will
-- backfire as the leader will get at least a castle's worth of units a turn earlier in
-- this case. Several events and macros control this. (About half of this file actually.)

We finally made it out of the mountains. We crossed the Ford of Abez late this morning, and hiked the rest of the day south-east, making for the town of Tath. We planned to split up there. I was going to go south to Dan’Tonk and Weldyn to spread our news, and Ras-Tabahn was to head toward Elensefar to carry out his plan of carving out a special place for us in the world.
