-- Walking corpses are summoned from graves using the right-click menu. Each grave is
-- marked by a stone on the map and has its own terrain type. Each can only be used once,
-- so a pile of dirt is used to mark one after it is used. After the player captures the
-- guardhouse, they can summon skeletons as well, but that ability is lost if the enemy
-- units retake it. The opening has some interesting WML to keep Ardonna hidden while
-- the guards are talking amongst themselves. It is explained there.
