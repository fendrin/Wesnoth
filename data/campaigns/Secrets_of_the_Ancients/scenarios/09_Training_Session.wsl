-- Ras-Tahban starts in the keep, and the DAs are in castle tiles. It looks better with
-- the keep not actually attached to the castle. So, to make the castle tiles function,
-- there is an invisible castle overlay on one of the grass tiles in between the two (3,10)
-- making the castle continuous. Nothing is supposed to be recruited on the grass tile
-- with the overlay, so the loyal kids are both set to start on it to block it. But, the
-- kids may be dead. In that case, a dummy unit is used. Its image is an empty .png,
-- and has no movement points. It is petrified so it can't be attacked, and It is deleted
-- after the first turn (when no more recruits are possible.)

More important was the escape from the drudgery of a fixed future, planned in advance by their parents. Ras-Tabahn spent a number of days in the forest outside of Carcyn instructing them on how to call on the spirit world and channel a small amount of its power. Soon after they moved on, they came across three farmsteads on the riverbank that had clearly been raided."
