    <UNDERGROUND!

-- This scenario will take place on a throneroom map which is, effectively,
-- all castle.  It should have two keep hexes on it, one near the front
-- for our heroes and one at the rear for Karrag. Features of the
-- map must include an indication of a doorway in the cave wall near the
-- rear dais.  The throneroom map should in general look like a distorted
-- mirror image of Hamel's, but with the braziers unlit.
--
-- Aiglondur, Angarthing, and a few of their veteran followers face Karrag,
-- flanked by several of his followers.  Dulcatulos escorts our heroes.
-- Karrag's group should have black team disks and Dulcatulos a blue one.
