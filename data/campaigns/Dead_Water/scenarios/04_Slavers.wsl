-- You're welcome for the free, loyal brawler. There are two cages on the
-- shore. One contains Keshan, a drake burner who can be *very* useful
-- during the campaign, and the other contains a poacher named
-- Siddry. He's not going to be much help here; you will have to work
-- to keep him alive, and he won't come with you. However, if you
-- succeed, he comes back in The Flaming Sword with some friends who
-- are a big help taking villages in the beginning (and not much help
-- thereafter). If Siddry lives, he will be stored in a variable until
-- then. The shipwreck in the north contains a treasure chest with 100
-- gold.
--
-- Send someone north to get gold. Recruit about two castles, one of
-- which should be all level 2's. Hopefully that includes at least one
-- more healer. Healers are *essential* here. Any units close to
-- leveling are especially good. Send everyone east. Be aggressive in
-- taking out the troops and getting to the leader, but don't leave any
-- units out and exposed. You should probably instigate the slave
-- rebellion as night comes at the end of your first offensive. That
-- will keep some the retalliation against you low, and slow down the
-- saurians coming towards you from the north. When it's safe, rescue
-- the drake, and try to get him some experience--carefully. After
-- taking out the leader, you can recruit a unit or two as
-- replacements, but you shouldn't need more than that. You should just
-- be getting involved with the first wave from the north leader
-- now. (He's slowed down by the water.) Sit tight around the castle
-- until the enemy onslaught has thinned out. After that it should be
-- no problem wiping out the other two leaders--if you have survived
-- this far, you have quite a few high-level units.
