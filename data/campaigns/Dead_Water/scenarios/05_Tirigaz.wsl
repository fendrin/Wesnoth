-- This level is not too hard. Don't go too negative on gold, but
-- recruit three or four high-level units. You need mostly leveled
-- initiates for their magic ranged attacks. Keshan is a big help, and
-- so is the unit with the storm trident. If you decide to go after the
-- orc leader, wait until the undead are dispatched. Heal everyone,
-- then assemble just to the north of his keep. Don't touch the ships
-- or piers though! Wait until day time, then send in all the units
-- with magical attacks. Use other units to keep the slurbows
-- busy. Hopefully the leader won't kill anyone before your next
-- turn. One more round of magical attacks should kill him before his
-- recruits start beating you up. Killing the orc leader isn't really
-- necessary, but he helps someone level up, and he has a fair bit of
-- gold. The next level is much easier with lots of gold.

-- A lot of the code here is to activate the orc side if the mermen do
-- anything wrong, and keep it passive until then. There is also some
-- animation of the orcs coming out to tear down the keep after the
-- first turn.
