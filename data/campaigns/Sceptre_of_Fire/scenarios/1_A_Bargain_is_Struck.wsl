-- Historical note:
-- The conversation Haldric alludes to took place in the Legend of
-- Wesmere scenario "The Treaty", which is thus pinned to 15YW.
-- This scenario establishes that Landar is already leading a
-- Xenophobic faction at start of this campaign, e.g 25YW.  This
-- development is noted as having begun on the main timeline in 24YW.
-- Be careful to change this chronology consistently, if you do so.
