-- This appoints the Advisor role to our most advanced unit coming out of The Bay of Pearls. This would be
-- the same as the initial Advisor we would appoint if we took the path through Muff Malal's Peninsula, and
-- will be the initial Advisor recalled at the start of The Siege of Elensefar.
--
-- We store a copy of this Advisor, giving it a new id. This is done in prestart because the recall list will
-- not be available at the point the ship returns to collect Konrad. When the ship comes to collect Konrad,
-- we will unstore this copy and hide it before it speaks its line. This way the ship appears to be selected,
-- but the unit's name, profile image and details are displayed; just as if the unit were inside the ship.
--
-- This was an old TODO item, now done. That TODO also suggested having the Advisor speak on enemies defeated
-- as well as turns over. So I moved the WML for the line to place it in the macro and re-ordered a bit so it
-- works and still looks the same on time over.
