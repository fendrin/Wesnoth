    description: _ "The Freelands, also known to the people of the far east as The Land of No Kings, lie in between the Wilderlands and the Kingdom of Carorath, separating a land of absolute law from a land of absolute savagery. The people of the Freelands have been battling would-be conquerors of their land for hundreds of years, repelling great beasts from their western borders, and Carorathian Imperialists from their eastern borders."
