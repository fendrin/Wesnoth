Battle for Wesnoth for GP2x, pre-Alpha
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
This is a very early pre-alpha release of Battle for Wesnoth for the GP2X. 
It's not really playable. Here is a list of some known and still existing 
problems, though there is a lot more:

- sound can be jittery (disabled now; it slows everything down considerably)
- very slow when starting a campaign (might take several mins)
- slow in general
- game might crash in complex scenarios due too much mem usage
- team color disabled, many units will have pink cloths
- no language selection (functionality removed)
- no networking (functionality removed)
- no language switching (funtionality remove)
 
What to do with the archive:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have all the content from this archive in a folder named 'wesnoth' on the 
root of your sd-card (/mnt/sd/). Start the game via the startscript named
wesnoth.gpe. The first start of the game may take several minutes because 
of the cache generation. Starting a campaign will take a long time, too, 
because of the campaign specific cache generation. There will be *no* 
loadscreen while this cache is being created. Remember that this is a very 
early alpha. ;-)

Button mappings:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since there's no keyboard-only (or rather: joystick-only) interface, one
has to move the mouse cursor using joystick. Also, the following buttons
have predefined special functions:

	A	- left mouse click
	B	- right mouse click
	RIGHT 	- skip to next unit
	LEFT	- skip to previous unit
	X	- select the leader
	Y	- "show enemy moves"
	STICK	- undo the previous move
	START	- use accelerated mode
	SELECT	- recruit
